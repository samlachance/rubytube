# Rubytube

## About
Rubytube is a simple ruby program that allows you to search Youtube and watch videos from your terminal.

## How does it work?
After you tell Rubytube what you'd like to watch, it scrapes the Youtube webpage and presents to you the first 20 or so videos. After you choose which video you would like to watch, Rubytube will launch VLC from the terminal with the video's URL as its argument.

## Requirements
Rubytube requires nokogiri, open-uri, and VLC.
